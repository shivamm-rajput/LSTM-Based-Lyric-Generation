[Intro]I have a poem here. It's not a poem, it's... This is the first concert I played alone in New York, really. An a fellow in Brooklyn State Hospital, his name is Woody Guthrie. But Woody is more than a folk singer. He's really something else more than a folk singer and there's this book coming out that's dedicated to him. And they asked me to write something about Woody, like what does Woody mean to you in 25 words. And I couldn't do it, I wrote out 5 pages and I have it here. I have it here by accident actually. But I'd like to say this out loud. So this is my feelings towards Woody Guthrie. Cannot really be told in how many records of his I buy, it's a lot more than that actually. So if you can roll along with this thing here this is called "Last Thoughts On Woody Guthrie"[Verse 1]When yer head gets twisted and yer mind grows numbWhen you think you're too old, too young, too smart or too dumbWhen yer laggin' behind an' losing yer paceIn a slow-motion crawl of life's busy raceNo matter what yer doing if you start givin' upIf the wine don't come to the top of yer cupIf the wind's got you sideways with one hand holdin' onAnd the other starts slipping and the feeling is goneAnd yer train engine fire needs a new spark to catch itAnd the wood's easy findin' but yer lazy to fetch itAnd yer sidewalk starts curlin' and the street gets too longAnd you start walkin' backwards though you know its wrongAnd lonesome comes up as down goes the dayAnd tomorrow's morning seems so far awayAnd you feel the reins from yer pony are slippin'And yer rope is a-slidin' cause yer hands are a-drippin'And yer sun-decked desert and evergreen valleysTurn to broken down slums and trash-can alleysAnd yer sky cries water and yer drain pipe's a-pourin'And the lightnin's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashin'And the windows are rattlin' and breakin' and the roof tops a-shakin'And yer whole world's a-slamming  and bangingAnd yer minutes of sun turn to hours of stormAnd to yourself you sometimes say"I never knew it was gonna be this wayWhy didn't they tell me the day I was born"And you start gettin' chills and yer jumping from sweatAnd you're looking for something you ain't quite found yetAnd yer knee-deep in the dark water with yer hands in the airAnd the whole world's a-watching with a window peek stareAnd yer good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flyingAnd yer heart feels sick like fish when they're fryingAnd yer jackhammer falls from yer hand to yer feetAnd you need it badly but it lays on the streetAnd yer bell's bangin' loudly but you can't hear its beatAnd you think yer ears might a been hurtOr yer eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirtAnd you figured you failed in yesterdays rushWhen you were faked out an' fooled while facing a four flushAnd all the time you were holdin' three queensAnd it's making you mad, it's makin' you meanLike in the middle of Life magazineBouncin' around a pinball machineAnd there's something on yer mind you wanna be sayingThat somebody someplace oughta be hearin'But it's trapped on yer tongue and sealed in yer headAnd it bothers you badly when you're laying in bedAnd no matter how you try you just can't say itAnd yer scared to yer soul you just might forget itAnd yer eyes get swimmy from the tears in yer headAnd yer pillows of feathers turn to blankets of leadAnd the lion's mouth opens and yer staring at his teethAnd his jaws start closing with you underneathAnd yer flat on your belly with yer hands tied behindAnd you wish you'd never taken that last detour signAnd you say to yourself just what am I doingOn this road I'm walkin', on this trail I'm turnin'On this curve I'm hangingOn this pathway I'm strolling, in the space I'm takingIn this air I'm inhalingAm I mixed up too much, am I mixed up too hardWhy am I walking, where am I runningWhat am I saying, what am I knowingOn this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm frailin'On this mandolin I'm strumming, in the song I'm singin'In the tune I'm humming, in the words I'm writin'In the words that I'm thinkingIn this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinkin'Who am I helping, what am I breakingWhat am I giving, what am I takingBut you try with your whole soul bestNever to think these thoughts and never to letThem kind of thoughts gain groundOr make yer heart poundBut then again you know when they're aroundJust waiting for a chance to slip and drop down'Cause sometimes you hear'em when the night times comes creepingAnd you fear that they might catch you a-sleepingAnd you jump from yer bed, from yer last chapter of dreamin'And you can't remember for the best of yer thinkingIf that was you in the dream that was screamingAnd you know that it's something special you're needin'And you know that there's no drug that'll do for the healin'And no liquor in the land to stop yer brain from bleedingAnd you need something specialYeah, you need something special all rightYou need a fast flying train on a tornado trackTo shoot you someplace and shoot you backYou need a cyclone wind on a stream engine howlerThat's been banging and booming and blowing foreverThat knows yer troubles a hundred times overYou need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no raceThat won't laugh at yer looksYour voice or your faceAnd by any number of bets in the bookWill be rolling long after the bubblegum crazeYou need something to open up a new doorTo show you something you seen beforeBut overlooked a hundred times or moreYou need something to open your eyesYou need something to make it knownThat it's you and no one else that ownsThat spot that yer standing, that space that you're sittingThat the world ain't got you beatThat it ain't got you lickedIt can't get you crazy no matter how manyTimes you might get kickedYou need something special all rightYou need something special to give you hopeBut hope's just a wordThat maybe you said or maybe you heardOn some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve

[Verse 1]Some of us turn off the lights and we liveWith the moonlight shooting bySome of us scare ourselves to death in the darkTo be where the angels flyPretty maids all in a row lined upOutside my cabin doorI've never wanted any of them wanting meExcept the girl from the Red River Shore[Verse 2]Well, I sat by her side and for a while I triedTo make that girl my wifeShe gave me her best advice and she saidGo home and lead a quiet lifeWell, I been to the east and I been to the westAnd I been out where the black winds roarSomehow though I never did get that farWith the girl from the Red River Shore[Verse 3]Well, I knew when I first laid eyes on herI could never be freeOne look at her and I knew right awayShe should always be with meWell, the dream dried up a long time agoDon't know where it is anymoreTrue to life, true to meWas the girl from the Red River Shore

[Verse 1]I once loved a girl, her skin it was bronzeWith the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawnI courted her proudly but now she is goneGone as the season she's taken[Verse 2]In a young summer's youth, I stole her awayFrom her mother and sister, though close did they stayEach one of them suffering from the failures of their dayWith strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us[Verse 3]Of the two sisters, I loved the youngWith sensitive instincts, she was the creative oneTheir constant scrapegoat, she was easily undoneBy the jealousy of others around her[Verse 4]For her parasite sister, I had no respectBound by her boredom, her pride to protectCountless visions of the other she'd reflectAs a crutch for her scenes and her society[Verse 5]Myself, for what I did, I cannot be excusedThe changes I was going through can't even be usedFor the lies that I told her in hope not to loseThe could-be dream-lover of my lifetime

[Verse 1]SometimesI feel so low-down and disgustedCan't help but wonder what's happening to my companionsAre they lost or are they found?Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring downAll their earthly principles they're going to have to abandon?[Chorus]And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend[Verse 2]I had a womanDown in AlabamaShe was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realisticShe said, "Boy, without a doubtHave to quit your mess and straighten outYou could die down here, be just another accident statistic"[Chorus]And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend[Verse 3]All that foreign oilControlling American soilLook around you, it's just bound to make you embarrassedSheiks walking around like kingsWearing fancy jewels and nose ringsDeciding America's future from Amsterdam and Paris

[Verse 1]Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spendBe it mine right or wrongfullyI let it slip gladly to my friendsTo tie up the time most forcefully[Chorus]But the bottles are doneWe've killed each one and the table's full and overflowedAnd the corner sign says it's closin' timeSo I'll bid farewell and be down the road[Verse 2]Oh, every girl that ever I've touchedI did not do it harmfullyAnd every girl that ever I've hurtI did not do it knowingly[Chorus]But to remain as friendsYou need the time to make amends and stay behindAnd since my feet are now fast and point away from the pastI'll bid farewell and be down the line[Verse 3]Oh, every foe that ever I facedThe cause was there before we cameAnd every cause that ever I foughtI fought it full without regret or shame

[Verse 1]John Wesley HardingWas a friend to the poorHe traveled a'with a gun in ev'ry handAll along this countrysideHe opened a'many a doorBut he was never knownTo hurt an honest man[Verse 2]’Twas down in Chaynee CountyA time they talk aboutWith his lady by his sideHe took a standAnd soon the situation thereWas all but straightened outFor he was always knownTo lend a helping hand[Verse 3]All across the telegraphHis name it did resoundBut no charge held against himCould they proveAnd there was no man aroundWho could track or chain him downHe was never knownTo make a foolish move

[Verse 1]As I went out one morningTo breathe the air around Tom Paine’sI spied the fairest damselThat ever did walk in chainsI offered her my handShe took me by the armI knew that very instantShe meant to do me harm[Verse 2]“Depart from me this moment”I told her with my voiceSaid she, “But I don’t wish to”Said I, “But you have no choice”“I beg you, sir,” she pleadedFrom the corners of her mouth“I will secretly accept youAnd together we’ll fly south”[Verse 3]Just then Tom Paine, himselfCame running from across the fieldShouting at this lovely girlAnd commanding her to yieldAnd as she was letting go her gripUp Tom Paine did run“I’m sorry, sir,” he said to me“I’m sorry for what she’s done”

[Verse 1]I've been a moonshinerFor seventeen long yearsI've spent all my moneyOn whiskey and beerI go to some hollowAnd sit at my stillAnd if whiskey don't kill meThen I don't know what will[Harmonica Solo][Verse 2]I go to some bar roomAnd drink with my friendsWhere the women can't followAnd see what I spendGod bless them pretty womenI wish they was mineTheir breath is as sweetThe dew on the vine[Harmonica Solo][Verse 3]Let me eat when I am hungryLet me drink when I am dryA dollar when I am hard upReligion when I dieThe whole world's a bottleAnd life's but a dramWhen the bottle gets emptyIt sure ain't worth a damn

[Verse 1]Up on the white verandaShe wears a necktie and a Panama hatHer passport shows a faceFrom another time and placeShe looks nothing like thatAnd all the remnants of her recent pastAre scattered in the wild windShe walks across the marble floorWhere a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on inShe smiles, walks the other wayAs the last ship sails and the moon fades awayFrom Black Diamond Bay[Verse 2]As the morning light breaks open, the Greek comes downAnd he asks for a rope and a pen that will write“Pardon, monsieur,” the desk clerk saysCarefully removes his fez“Am I hearing you right?”And as the yellow fog is liftingThe Greek is quickly heading for the second floorShe passes him on the spiral staircaseThinking he’s the Soviet AmbassadorShe starts to speak, but he walks awayAs the storm clouds rise and the palm branches swayOn Black Diamond Bay

[Verse 1]What’s the matter with meI don’t have much to sayDaylight sneaking through the windowAnd I’m still in this all-night caféWalking to and fro beneath the moonOut to where the trucks are rolling slowTo sit down on this bank of sandAnd watch the river flow[Verse 2]Wish I was back in the cityInstead of this old bank of sandWith the sun beating down over the chimney topsAnd the one I love so close at handIf I had wings and I could flyI know where I would goBut right now I’ll just sit here so contentedlyAnd watch the river flow[Chorus]People disagreeing on all just about everything, yeahMakes you stop and all wonder whyWhy only yesterday I saw somebody on the streetWho just couldn’t help but cryOh, this old river keeps on rolling, thoughNo matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blowAnd as long as it does I’ll just sit hereAnd watch the river flow

[Verse 1]Well, there was this movie I seen one timeAbout a man riding ’cross the desert and it starred Gregory PeckHe was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himselfThe townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck[Verse 2]Well, the marshal, now he beat that kid to a bloody pulpAs the dying gunfighter lay in the sun and gasped for his last breath“Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and squareI want him to feel what it’s like to every moment face his death”[Verse 3]Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling inAnd you know it blows right through me like a ball and chainYou know I can’t believe we’ve lived so long and are still so far apartThe memory of you keeps calling after me like a rolling train[Verse 4]I can still see the day that you came to me on the painted desertIn your busted down Ford and your platform heelsI could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meetAh, but you were right. It was perfect as I got in behind the wheel[Verse 5]Well, we drove that car all night into San Anton’And we slept near the Alamo, your skin was so tender and softWay down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came backI would have gone on after you but I didn’t feel like letting my head get blown off

We carried you in our arms on Independence DayAnd now you'd throw us all aside and put us on our wayOh, what dear daughter 'neath the sun would treat a father soTo wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer no?Tears of rage, tears of griefWhy am I always the one who must be the thief?Come to me now, you know we're so aloneAnd life is briefIt was all pointed out the way to go and scratched your name in sandThough you just thought that it was nothing more than a place for you to standNow I want you to know that while you were watched, discovered that there was no one trueThat I myself really thoughtIt was just a childish thing to doTears of rage, tears of griefWhy am I always the one who must be the thief?Come to me now, you know we're so aloneAnd life is briefIt was all very, very painless when you ran out to receiveAll that false instruction which we never could believeAnd now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purseOh, but what kind of love is this which goes from bad to worse?

[Verse 1]There's an evening' haze settlin' over the townStarlight by the edge of the creekThe buyin' power of the proletariat's gone downMoney's gettin' shallow and weakThe place I love best is a sweet memoryIt's a new path that we trodThey say low wages are a realityIf we want to compete abroad[Verse 2]My cruel weapons have been put on the shelfCome sit down on my kneeYou are dearer to me than myselfAs you yourself can seeI'm listening' to the steel rails humGot both eyes tight shutJust sitting here trying to keep the hunger fromCreeping it's way into my gut[Chorus]Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behindBring me my boots and shoesYou can hang back or fight your best on the front lineSing a little bit of these workingman's blues
