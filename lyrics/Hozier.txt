[Verse 1]I watch the work of my kin, bold and boyfulToying somewhere between love and abuseCalling to join them the wretched and joyfulShaking the wings of their terrible youthsFreshly disowned in some frozen devotionNo more alone or myself could I beLurched like a stray to the arms that were openNo shortage of sordid, no protest from me[Chorus]With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so meanShe's the angel of small death and the codeine sceneWith her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and leanShe's the angel of small death and the codeine scene[Verse 2]Feeling more human and hooked on her fleshI lay my heart down with the rest at her feetFresh from the fields, all fetor and fertileIt's bloody and raw, but I swear it is sweet[Chorus]With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so meanShe's the angel of small death and the codeine sceneWith her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and leanShe's the angel of small death and the codeine scene

[Verse 1]When stunted hand earns place with man by mere monstrosityAlarms are struck and shore is shook by sheer atrocityA cure I know that soothes the soul does so impossiblyA moment's silence when my baby puts the mouth onMe and my babe relax and catch the manic rhapsodyAll reason flown as God looks on in abject apathyA squall and all of me is a prayer in perfect pietyA moment's silence when my baby puts the mouth on me[Chorus]When the meaning's goneThere is clarityAnd the reason comes on the common tongue of your loving meAnd it's easy doneOur little remedyAnd the reason comes on the common tongue of your loving me[Verse 2]What yields the need for those who lead us oh-so morallyThose that would view the same we do through their deformityWho view the deed as power's creed as pure authorityThis moment's silence when my baby puts the mouth on me[Chorus]Since it all begunTo its reckoningThere the reason comes on the common tongue of your loving meBe thankful some know it lovinglyThere the reason comes in the common tongue of your loving me

[Verse 1]You know the distance never made a difference to meI swam a lake of fire, I'd have walked across the floor of any seaIgnored the vastness between all that can be seenAnd all that we believeSo I thought you were like an angel to me[Verse 2]Funny how true colours shine in darkness and in secrecyIf there were scarlet flags, they washed out in the mind of mеWhere a blindin' light shone on you еvery nightAnd either side of my sleepWhere you were held frozen like an angel to me[Chorus]It ain't the being alone (Sha-la-la)It ain't the empty home, baby (Sha-la-la)You know I'm good on my own (Sha-la-la)Sha-la-la, baby, you know, it's more the being unknownSo much of the livin', love, is the being unknown[Verse 3]You called me "angel" for the first time, my heart leapt from meYou smile now, I can see its pieces still stuck in your teethAnd what's left of it, I listen to it tickEvery tedious beatGoing unknown as any angel to me

[Verse 1]I still watch you when you're groovin'As if through water from the bottom of a poolYou're movin' without movin'And when you move, I'm movedYou are a call to motionThere, all of you, a verb in perfect viewLike Jonah on the oceanWhen you move, I'm moved[Pre-Chorus]When you moveI'm put to mind of all that I wanna beWhen you moveI could never define all that you are to me[Chorus]So move me, babyShake like the bough of a willow treeYou do it naturallyMove me, baby[Verse 2]You are the rite of movementIts reasonin' made lucid and coolAnd though it's no improvementWhen you move, I moveYou're less Polunin leapin'Or Fred Astaire in sequinsHoney, you, you're Atlas in his sleepin'And when you move, I'm moved

[Verse 1]So tired trying to see from behind the red in my eyesNo better version of me I could pretend to be tonightSoul deep in this swill with the most familiar of swineFor reasons wretched and divine[Verse 2]She blows out of nowhere, a roman candle of the wildLaughing her way through my feeble disguiseNo other version of me I would rather be tonightAnd Lord, she found me just in time[Pre-Chorus]'Cause with my mid-youth crisis all said and doneI need to be youthfully felt 'cause, God, I never felt young[Chorus]She's gonna save me, call me babyRun her hands through my hairShe'll know me crazy, soothe me dailyBetter yet, she wouldn't careWe'll steal her Lexus, be detectivesRide 'round picking up cluesWe'll name our children Jackie and WilsonRaise 'em on rhythm and blues

[Verse 1]True that I saw her hair like the branch of a treeA willow dancing on air before covering meUnder cotton and calicoesOver canopy dapple long ago[Verse 2]True that love in withdrawal was the weepin' of meThat the sound of the saw must be known by the treeMust be felled for to fight the coldI fretted fire, but that was long ago[Chorus]And it's not tonight (Oh, oh)Where I'm set alight (Oh, oh)And I blink in sight (Oh)Of your blinding light (Oh)Oh, and it's not tonight (Oh, oh)Where you hold me tight (Oh, oh)Light a fire bright (Oh)Oh, let it blaze alright (Oh)Oh, but you're good to me, oh, you're good to me (Oh, oh)Oh, but you're good to me, baby (Oh, oh)[Verse 3]With the roar of the fire, my heart rose to its feetLike the ashes of ash I saw rise in the heatSettle soft and as pure as snowI fell in love with the fire long ago

[Verse 1]When I first saw youThe end was soonTo Bethlehem, it slouchedAnd then, must've caught a good look at youGive your heart and soul to charity'Cause the rest of youThe best of youHoney, belongs to me[Pre-Chorus]Ain't it a gentle sound, the rolling in the graves?Ain't it like thunder under earth, the sound it makes?Ain't it exciting you, the rumble where you lay?Ain't you my baby, ain't you my baby?[Chorus]Nothing fucks with my babyNothing can get a look in on my babyNothing fucks with my babyNothing, nothing, nothing, nothing[Verse 2]If I was born as a blackthorn treeI'd wanna be felled by youHeld by youFuel the pyre of your enemies

[Verse 1]All the fear and the fire of the end of the worldHappens each time a boy falls in love with a girlHappens great, happens sweetHappily, I'm unfazed here too[Chorus]Wasteland, babyI'm in love, I'm in love with you[Verse 2]All the things yet to come are the things that have passedLike the holding of hands, like the breaking of glassLike the bonfire that burns that all words in the fight fell to[Chorus]Wasteland, babyI'm in love, I'm in love with youAnd I love too, that love soon might endBe known in its achingShown in the shakingLately of my wasteland, babyBe still, my indelible friend, you are unbreakingThough quaking, though crazyThat's just wasteland, baby

[Verse 1]Never feel too good in crowdsWith folks around when they're playingThe anthems of rape culture loudCrude and proud, creatures bayingAll I've ever done is hideFrom our times when you're near meHoney, when you kill the lights and kiss my eyesI feel like a person for a moment of my life[Pre-Chorus]But you don't know what hell you put me throughTo have someone kiss the skin that crawls from youTo feel your weight in arms, I'd never useIt's the God that heroin prays to[Chorus]It feels good, girl, it feels goodIt feels good, girl, it feels goodIt feels good, girl, it feels goodOh, to be alone with you[Refrain]Woah, oh, oh, ohOh, oh, oh, oh, ohWoah, oh, oh, ohOh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]I'd be the voice that urged OrpheusWhen her body was found (Hey, yeah)I'd be the choiceless hope in griefThat drove him underground (Hey, yeah)I'd be the dreadful need in the devoteeThat made him turn around (Hey, yeah)And I'd be the immediate forgiveness in EurydiceImagine being loved by me[Chorus]I won't deny I've got in my mind now (Hey, yeah)All the things I would doSo I try to talk refined for fear that you find out  (Hey, yeah)How I'm imaginin' you[Verse 2]I'd be the last shred of truthIn the lost myth of true love (Hey, yeah)I'd be the sweet feeling of releaseMankind now dreams of (Hey, yeah)That's found in the last witnessBefore the wave hits, marvelling at God (Hey, yeah)Before he feels alone one final time and marries the seaImagine being loved by me

[Intro]Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmmMmm, mmm, mmm, mmm[Verse 1]When I was a child, I heard voicesSome would sing and some would screamYou soon find you have few choicesI learned the voices died with meWhen I was a child, I'd sit for hoursStaring into open flame, something in it had a powerCould barely tear my eyes away[Chorus]All you have is your fireAnd the place you need to reachDon't you ever tame your demonsBut always keep them on a leash[Post-Chorus]Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmmMmm, mmm, mmm, mmm[Verse 2]When I was sixteen, my senses fooled meThought gasoline was on my clothesI knew that something would always rule meI knew this scent was mine alone

[Verse 1: Hozier]I have never known peaceLike the damp grass that yields to meI have never known hungerLike these insects that feast on meA thousand teethAnd yours among them, I knowOur hungers appeasedOur heartbeats becoming slow[Pre-Chorus: Both, Karen Cowley, Hozier]We lay here for years or for hoursThrown here or found, to freeze or to thawSo long, we'd become the flowersTwo corpses we were, two corpses I saw[Chorus: Karen Cowley & Hozier]And they'd find us in a weekWhen the weather gets hotAfter the insects have made their claimI'd be home with you, I'd be home with you[Verse 2: Karen Cowley]I have never known sleepLike this slumber that creeps to meI have never known colourLike this morning reveals to meAnd you haven't moved an inchSuch that I would not knowIf you sleep always like thisThe flesh calmly going cold

[Verse 1]For startsWhat a waste to say the heart could feel apartOr feel complete, babyWhy would you make out of words a cage for your own bird?When it sings so sweetThe screaming, heaving fuckery of the world?Why would you offer a name to the same old tired pain?When all things come from nothing and, honey, if nothing's gained?[Pre-Chorus]My heart is thrilled by the still of your handThat's how I know now that you understand[Chorus]There's no plan, there's no race to be runThe harder the rain, honey, the sweeter the sunThere's no plan, there's no kingdom to comeI'll be your man if you got love to get doneSit in and watch the sunlight fadeHoney, enjoy, it's gettin' lateThere's no plan, there's no hand on the reignAs Mack explained, there will be darkness again[Verse 2]Let it hurl, let the awful song be heardBlue bird, I know your beat, babyBut your secret is safe with me 'cause if secrets were like seedsKeep my body from the fire, hire a gardener for my graveYour secret is safe with me and if secrets were like seedsWhen I'm lying under marble, marvel at flowers you'll have made

[Verse 1]Do you think I'd give up?That this might've shook the love from meOr that I was on the brink?How could you think, darlin', I'd scare so easily?Now that it's doneThere's not one thing that I would changeMy life was a storm since I was bornHow could I fear any hurricane?[Pre-Chorus]If someone asked me at the end[Chorus]I'd tell them, "Put me back in it" (Da-ah, darlin')I would do it again (Ah-ah, ah-ah)If I could hold you for a minute (Da-ah, darlin')I'd go through it again (Ah-ah, ah-ah)[Post-Chorus]I would still be surprised I could find you, darlin', in any lifeIf I could hold you for a minuteDa-ah, darlin', I would do it again (Ah-ah, ah-ah)[Verse 2]For all that was saidOf where we'd end up at the end of itWhen the heart would cease, ours nеver knew peacеWhat good would it be on the far side of things?It was too soonWhen that part of you was ripped awayA grip takin' hold like a cancer that growsEach piece of your body that it takes

[Verse 1]Honey, this club here is stuck upDinner and diatribesI knew well from our first hookupThe look of mischief in your eyesYour friends are a fate that befell meHell is the talkin' typeI’d suffer hell if you'd tell meWhat you'd do to me tonight[Pre-Chorus]Tell me, tell me, tell me, ah[Chorus]That’s the kind of loveI've been dreamin' ofThat's the kind of loveI've been dreamin' of[Verse 2]Honey, I laugh when it sinks inA pillar I am, uprightScarcely can speak for my thinkin'What you'd do to me tonightNow that the evenin’ is slowin’Now that the end's in sightHoney, it’s easier knowin'What you'd do to me tonight

[Intro]If the wind turns, if I hit a squallAllow the ground to find its brutal way to me[Verse 1]I feel lighter than I have in so much timeI've crossed the border line of weightlessOne deep breath out from the skyI've reached a rarer height now that I can confirmAll our weight is just a burden offered to us by the world[Pre-Chorus]And though I burn, how could I fallWhen I am lifted by every word you say to me?[Chorus]If anything could fall at all, it's the worldThat falls away from me[Verse 2]You have me floatin' like a feather on the seaWhile you're as heavy as the worldThat you hold your hands beneathOnce I wondered what was holdin' up the groundBut I can see that all along, love, it was you all the way down

[Verse 1]She moved with shameless wonderThe perfect creature rarely seenSince some liar brought the thunderWhen the land was godless and freeHer eyes look sharp and steadyInto the empty parts of meStill, my heart is heavyWith the hate of some other man's beliefs[Pre-Chorus]Always a well-dressed fraudWho wouldn't spare the rodNever for me[Chorus]Screamin' the name of a foreigner's GodScreamin' the name of a foreigner's GodScreamin' the name of a foreigner's GodThe purest expression of grief[Verse 2]Wonderin' who I copyMusterin' some tender charmShe feels no control of her bodyShe feels no safety in my armsI've no language left to say itBut all I do is quake to herBreakin' if I try conveyingThe broken love I make to her

[Verse 1]What you're given, what you live inDarlin', it finds a way to live in youAnd your heart, love, has such darknessI feel it in the corners of the room[Refrain](If I was any closer) After the gloom(I could only lose me) I wanna lose me(If I fade away, let me fade away) I, I wanna fade away with you(If I was any closer) If I was any closer(I could only lose me) I could be lost(If I fade away, let me fade away) No more than I was or than I[Pre-Chorus]Want to be when you fall on me like night every timeAnd I want to be so far from sight and mindI wanna kill the lights[Chorus]I wanna run against the world that's turnin'I'd movе so fast that I'd outpace the dawnI wanna be gonеI wanna run so far, I'd beat the mornin'Before the dawn has come, I'd block the sunIf you want it done

[Verse 1]There is a roadway, muddy and foxglovedWhenever I'd have life enough, my heart is screamin' ofAnd in a few days I will be there, loveWhatever here that's left of me is yours, just as it was[Chorus]Just as it was, babyBefore the otherness cameAnd I knew its nameThe drug, the dark, the light, the flame[Post-Chorus]The highs hit the heights of my babyAnd its hold had the fight of my babyAnd the lights were as bright as my babyBut your love was unmoved[Verse 2]Tell me if, somehow, some of it remainsHow long you would wait for me and how long I've been awayThe shape that I'm in now, your shape in the doorwayMake your good love known to me or just tell me 'bout your day[Chorus]Just as it was, babyBefore the otherness cameAnd I knew its nameThe drug, the dark, the light, the shame

[Verse 1]I would shun the light, share in evening's cool and quietWho would trade that hum of nightFor sunlight, sunlight, sunlight?But whose heart would not take flightBetray the moon as acolyteOn first and fierce affirming sightOf sunlight, sunlight, sunlight?[Chorus]I had been lost to you, sunlightAnd flew like a moth to you, sunlight, oh, sunlightOh, your love is sunlightOh, your love is sunlightOh, but it is sunlight[Verse 2]All the tales the sameTold before and told againA soul that’s born in cold and rainKnows sunlight, sunlight, sunlightAnd, at last, can grant a nameTo a buried and a burning flameAs love and its decisive painOh, my sunlight, sunlight, sunlight

[Verse 1]At last, when all of the world is asleepYou take in the blackness of airThe likes of a darkness so deepThat God, at the start, couldn't bear[Verse 2]And sit unseen with only the inner upheldYour reflection can't offer a wordTo the bliss of not knowin' yourselfWith all mirrorin' gone from the world[Verse 3]But, still, the mind, rejectin' this new empty spaceFills it with somethin' or someoneNo closer could I be to GodOr why he would do what he's done[Outro]Bhfuilis soranna sorchaAch tagais 'nós na hoícheTrína chéileLe chéile, claochlaitheBhfuilis soranna sorchaAch tagais 'nós na hoícheIs claochlú an ealaínIs ealaín dubh íBhfuilis soranna sorchaAch tagais 'nós na hoíchеTrína chéileLe chéile, claochlaithеBhfuilis soranna sorchaAch tagais 'nós na hoícheIs claochlú an ealaínIs ealaín dubh í

[Verse 1]Sometimes, it returns like rain that you slept throughThat washed off the world, the streets looking brand newI will not be great, but I'm grateful to get throughThe feeling came late, I'm still glad I met you[Pre-Chorus]The memory hurts, but does me no harmYour hand in my pocket to keep us both warmThe poor thing in the road, its eye still glisteningThe cold wet of your nose, the earth from a distance[Chorus]See how it shinesSee how it shinesSee how it shinesSee how it shines[Post-Chorus]Oh-oh-oohOh-oh-oohOh-oh-oohOh-oh-ooh[Verse 2]Sometimes, there's a thought like you choose what you're doingBut it comes to naught when I look back through itI remember the view, streetlights in the dark blueThe moment I knew I'd no choice but to love you

[Verse 1]A two-tonne weight around my chest feels likeIt just dropped a twenty-storey heightIf there was anyone to ever get through this lifeWith their heart still intact, they didn't do it rightThe last time I felt your weight on my chest, you said"We didn't get it right, but, love, we did our best"And we will again[Pre-Chorus]Movin' on in time and takin' more fromEverything that ends[Chorus]And all things endAll that we intend is scrawled in sandAnd slips right through our handsAnd just knowin' that everything will endShould not change our plans when wе begin again[Post-Chorus]We begin again, mm[Verse 2]I havе never known a silence like the one fallen hereNever watched my future darken in a single tearI know we want this to go easy by bein' somebody's faultBut we've gone long enough to know this isn't what we wantAnd that isn't always bad

[Verse 1]Just a little rush, babe, to feel dizzyTo derail the mind of meJust a little hush, babe, my veins are busyBut my heart's in atrophy[Pre-Chorus]Any way to distract and sedateAdding shadows to the walls of the cave[Chorus]You and I, nursing on a poison that never stungOur teeth and lungs are lined with the scum of itSome whiff of this, death and guts, we are deaf, we are numbFree and young and we can feel none of it[Verse 2]Somethin' isn't right, babe, I keep catchin'Little words, but the meaning's thinI'm somewhere outside my life, babe, I keep scratchin'But, somehow, I can't get in[Pre-Chorus]So we're slaves to any semblance of touchLord, we should quit, but we love it too much

[Verse 1]Remember once I told you aboutHow before I heard it from your mouthMy name would always hit my ears as such an awful sound?And the soul, if that's what you'd call itUneasy ally of the body, it felt nameless as a riverUndiscovered underground[Pre-Chorus]And the first time that you kissed meI drank dry the River LetheThe Liffey would have been softer on my stomach all the sameBut you spoke some quick new musicThat went so far to soothe this soulAs it was and ever shall be, unearth without a name[Chorus]Some part of me must have diedThe first time that you called me "baby"And some part of me came aliveThe first time that you called me "baby"[Verse 2]These days, I think I owe my lifeTo flowers that were left here by my motherAin't that like them, giftin' life to you againThis life lived mostly undergroundUnknowin' either sight nor soundTill reachin' up for sunlight just to be ripped out by the stem

[Verse 1]A husband waits outsideA crying child pushes a child into the nightShe was told he would come this timeWithout leaving so much as a feather behindTo enact, at last, the perfect planOne more sweet boy to be butchered by men[Chorus]But the gateway to the worldWas still outside the reach of himWould never belong to angelsHad never belonged to manThe swan upon LedaEmpire upon Jerusalem[Verse 2]A grandmother smuggling medsPast where the god-child soldier, Sétanta, stood deadOur graceful turner of headsWeaves through the checkpoints like a needle and threadSomeone's frightened boy waves her onShe offers a mother's smile and soon, she's gone[Chorus]The gateway to the worldThe gun in a trembling handWhere nature unmakes the boundaryThe pillar of myth still standsThe swan upon LedaOccupier upon ancient land

[Verse 1]You know better, babe, you know better, babeThan to look at it, look at it like thatYou know better, babe, you know better, babeThan to talk to it, talk to it like that[Pre-Chorus]Don't give it a hand, offer it a soulHoney, make this easyLeave it to the land, this is what it knowsHoney, that's how it sleeps[Chorus]Don't let it in with no intention to keep itJesus Christ, don't be kind to itHoney, don't feed it, it will come back[Verse 2]You know better, babe, you know better, babeThan to smile at me, smile at me like thatYou know better babe, you know better babeThan to hold me just, hold me just like that[Pre-Chorus]I know who I am when I'm aloneI'm something else when I see youYou don't understand, you should never knowHow easy you are to need

[Verse 1]My head was warm, my skin was soakedI called your name till the fever brokeWhen I awoke, the moon still hungThe night, so black that the darkness humsI raised myself, my legs were weakI prayed my mind be good to meAn awful noise filled the airI heard a scream in the woods somewhere[Chorus]Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh[Verse 2]A woman's voice, I quickly ranInto the trees with empty handsA fox, it was, he shook afraidI spoke no words, no sound he madeHis bone exposed, his hind was lameI raised a stone to end his painWhat caused the wound? How large, the teeth?I sure knew eyes were watchin' me[Chorus]Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Intro: Hozier]One, two, three[Verse 1: Hozier]It's the sound of it that brings me thereThis city locked into the song of prayerThat finds no melodyEvery moment of the working dayThe twitching muscles in each step I takeThe prayer is all of me[Chorus: Hozier & Bedouine]That I'd beAnywhere that you are, that you areThat I'd beAnywhere that you are, that you are[Verse 2: Bedouine]Maybe I have yet to venture outSee the places that I hear aboutPlanes and trains and carsCarve their lines into a curve like bladesAll I get to are mistakes half-madeLeave the door ajar[Chorus: Hozier & Bedouine]But I'd beAnywhere that you are, that you areThat I'd beAnywhere that you are, you are

[Verse 1]What you're given, what you live inDarlin', it finds a way to live in youAnd your heart, love, has such darknessI feel it in the corners of the room[Refrain]After the gloomI wanna lose meI, I wanna fade away with youIf I was any closerI could be lostNo more than I was or than I[Pre-Chorus]Want to be when you fall on me like night every timeAnd I want to be so far from sight and mindI wanna kill the lights[Chorus]I wanna run against the world that's turnin'I'd move so fast that I'd outpace the dawnI wanna be goneI wanna run so far, I'd beat the mornin'Before the dawn has come, I'd block the sunIf you want it done

[Intro]One, two, threeIf the wind turns, if I hit a squallAllow the ground to find its brutal way to me[Verse 1]I feel lighter than I have in so much timeI've crossed the borderline of weightlessOne deep breath out from the skyI've reached a rarer height now that I can confirmAll our weight is just a burden offered to us by the world[Pre-Chorus]And though I burn, how could I fallWhen I am lifted by every word you say to me?[Chorus]If anything could fall at all, it's the worldThat falls away from me[Verse 2]You have me floatin' like a feather on the seaWhile you'rе as heavy as the worldThat you hold your hands benеathOnce I wondered what was holdin' up the groundBut I can see that all along, love, it was you all the way down

[Verse 1]Ask me again when "I want more" endsHoney, they're wavin' that flag againAnd Lord, they're calling the desperate menCryin' out "war is peace, let the dogs off the leash"Who'll be the stick when the drum gets beat?I broke before hitting skin or sheetThat noise and shape of you in the streetHoney, you weren't known to be discreetYou weren't known to be discreet[Chorus]Lord, how many ears have heard the lie? (Do-do-do-do-do)How many worse off than you and I? (Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)How many bad dreams I've had at night?
