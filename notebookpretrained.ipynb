laying in bedWondering if she\\'d changed at allIf her hair was still redHer folks they said our lives togetherSure was going to be roughThey never did like Mama\\'s homemade dressPapa\\'s bankbook wasn\\'t big enoughAnd I was standing on the side of the roadRain falling on my shoesHeading out for the East CoastLord knows I\\'ve paid some duesGetting throughTangled up in blue[Verse 2]She was married when we first metSoon to be divorcedI helped her out of a jam, I guessBut I used a little too much forceWe drove that car as far as we couldAbandoned it out westSplit up on a dark sad nightBoth agreeing it was bestShe turned around to look at meAs I was walking awayI heard her say over my shoulder\"We\\'ll meet again somedayOn the avenue\"Tangled up in blue\\n\\n[Verse 1]Darkness at the break of noonShadows even the silver spoonThe handmade blade, the child\\'s balloonEclipses both the sun and moonTo understand you know too soonThere is no sense in trying[Verse 2]Pointed threats they bluff with scornSuicide remarks are tornFrom the fool\\'s gold mouthpiece the hollow hornPlays wasted words, proves to warnThat he not busy being bornIs busy dying[Verse 3]Temptation\\'s page flies out the doorYou follow, find yourself at warWatch waterfalls of pity roarYou feel to moan, but unlike beforeYou discover that you\\'d just be one morePerson crying[Chorus]So don\\'t fear if

mighty trapsPounced with fire on flaming roadsUsing ideas as my maps\"We\\'ll meet on edges, soon,\" said IProud \\'neath heated brow[Refrain]Ah, but I was so much older thenI\\'m younger than that now[Verse 2]Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth\"Rip down all hate,\" I screamedLies that life is black and whiteSpoke from my skull, I dreamedRomantic facts of musketeersFoundationed deep, somehow[Refrain]Ah, but I was so much older thenI\\'m younger than that now[Verse 3]Girls\\' faces formed the forward pathFrom phony jealousyTo memorizing politicsOf ancient historyFlung down by corpse evangelistsUnthought of, though, somehow\\n\\n[Verse 1]If you’re travelin\\' in the north country fairWhere the winds hit heavy on the borderlineRemember me to one who lives thereFor she once was a true love of mine[Verse 2]If you go when the snowflakes stormWhen the rivers freeze and summer endsPlease see she has a coat so warmTo keep her from the howling winds[Verse 3]Please see if her hair hangs longIf it rolls and flows all down her breastPlease see for me if her hair\\'s hangin\\' longFor that’s the way I remember her best[Verse 4]I’m a-wondering if she remembers me at allMany times I’ve often prayedIn the darkness of my nightIn the brightness of my day[Instrumental Break]\\n\\n[Verse 1]Come, you masters of war, you that build the big gunsYou that build the death planes,

with my world like it\\'s your little toyYou put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyesAnd you turn and run farther when the fast bullets fly[Verse 3]Like Judas of old, you lie and deceiveA world war can be won you want me to believeBut I see through your eyes and I see through your brainLike I see through the water that runs down my drain[Verse 4]You fasten all the triggers for the others to fireThen you set back and watch while the death count gets higherYou hide in your mansion while the young people\\'s bloodFlows out of their bodies and is buried in the mud[Verse 5]You\\'ve thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurledFear to bring children into the worldFor threatening my baby, unborn and unnamedYou ain\\'t worth the blood that runs in your veins\\n\\n[Verse 1]You must leave now, take what you need, you think will lastBut whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fastYonder stands your orphan with his gunCrying like a fire in the sunLook out, the saints are coming throughAnd it\\'s all over now, Baby Blue[Verse 2]The highway is for gamblers, better use your senseTake what you have gathered from coincidenceThe empty-handed painter from your streetsIs drawing crazy patterns on your sheetsThe sky, too, is folding under youAnd it\\'s all over now, Baby Blue[Verse 3]All your seasick sailors, they are rowing homeYour empty-handed armies are going homeYour lover, who just walked out the doorHas taken all his blankets from the floorThe carpet, too, is moving under youAnd it\\'s all over now, Baby Blue[Instrumental Bridge]\\n\\n[Verse 1]You walk into the roomWith your pencil in your handYou see somebody nakedAnd you, you say, \"Who is that man?\"You try so hardBut you don\\'t understandJust what you will sayWhen you get home[Refrain]Because something

landin\\'?[Verse 2]No, there\\'s nothin\\' you can send me, my own true loveThere\\'s nothin\\' I\\'m a-wishing to be ownin\\'Just a-carry yourself back to me unspoiledFrom across that lonesome ocean[Verse 3]Ah, but I just thought you might want somethin\\' fineMade of silver or of goldenEither from the mountains of MadridOr from the coast of Barcelona[Verse 4]But if I had the stars of the darkest nightAnd the diamonds from the deepest oceanI\\'d forsake them all for your sweet kissFor that\\'s all I\\'m wishin\\' to be ownin\\'[Verse 5]Well, I might be gone a long old timeAnd it\\'s only that I\\'m askingIs there somethin\\' I can send you to remember me byTo make your time more easy passin\\'?\\n\\n[Verse 1]Ain\\'t it just like the night to playTricks when you\\'re trying to be so quiet?We sit here strandedThough we\\'re all doing our best to deny itAnd Louise holds a handful of rain, tempting you to defy itLights flicker from the opposite loftIn this room the heat pipes just coughThe country music station plays softBut there\\'s nothing, really nothing to turn offJust Louise and her lover so entwinedAnd these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind[Verse 2]In the empty lot where the ladies playBlindman\\'s bluff with the key chainAnd the all-night girlsThey whisper of escapades out on the \"D\" trainWe can hear the night watchman click his flashlightAsk himself if it\\'s him or them that\\'s insaneLouise, she\\'s all right, she\\'s just nearShe\\'s delicate and seems like the mirrorBut she just makes it all too concise and too clearThat Johanna\\'s not hereThe ghost of \\'lectricity howls in the bones of her faceWhere these visions of Johanna have now taken my place\\n\\n[Verse 1]\\'Twas in another lifetimeOne of toil and bloodWhen blackness was a virtueThe road was full of mudI came in from the wildernessA creature void of form\"Come in,\" she said, \"I\\'ll give yaShelter from the storm\"[Verse 2]And if I pass this way againYou can rest assuredI\\'ll always do my best for herOn that I give my wordIn a world of steel-eyed death and menWho are fighting to be warm\"Come in,\" she said, \"I\\'ll give yaShelter from the storm\"[Verse 3]Not a word was spoke between usThere was little risk involvedEverything up to that pointHad been left unresolvedTry imagining a placeWhere it\\'s always safe and warm\"Come in,\" she said, \"I\\'ll give yaShelter from the storm\"\\n\\n[Verse 1]The pale moon rose in its gloryOut o\\'er the Western townShe told a sad, sad storyOf the great ship that went down[Verse 2]T\\'was the fourteenth day of AprilOver the waves she rodeSailing into tomorrowTo a gilded age foretold[Verse 3]The night was black with starlightThe seas were sharp and clearMoving through the shadowsThe promised hour was near[Verse 4]Lights were holding steadyGliding over the foamAll the lords and ladiesHeading for their eternal home[Verse 5]The chandeliers were swayingFrom the balustrades aboveThe orchestra was playingSongs of faded love\\n\\n[Verse 1]Lay, lady, layLay across my big brass bedLay, lady, layLay across my big brass bedWhatever colors you have in your mindI’ll show them to you and you’ll see

makeEverything\\'s flowing all at the same timeI live on a boulevard of crimeI drive fast cars, and I eat fast foodsI contain multitudes\\n\\n[Verse 1]Someone’s got it in for meThey’re planting stories in the pressWhoever it is I wish they’d cut it out quickBut when they will I can only guessThey say I shot a man named GrayAnd took his wife to ItalyShe inherited a million bucksAnd when she died it came to meI can’t help it if I’m lucky[Verse 2]People see me all the timeAnd they just can’t remember how to actTheir minds are filled with big ideasImages and distorted factsEven you, yesterdayYou had to ask me where it was atI couldn’t believe after all these yearsYou didn’t know me any better than thatSweet lady[Chorus]Idiot windBlowing every time you move your mouthBlowing down the backroads heading southIdiot windBlowing every time you move your teethYou’re an idiot, babeIt’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe\\n\\n[Verse 1]They sat together in the parkAs the evening sky grew darkShe looked at him and he felt a sparkTingle to his bones\\'Twas then he felt aloneAnd wished that he\\'d gone straightAnd watched out for a simple twist of fate[Verse 2]They walked alone by the old canalA little confused, I remember wellAnd stopped into a strange hotelWith a neon burning brightHe felt the heat of the nightHit him like a freight trainMoving with a simple twist of fate[Verse 3]A saxophone someplace far-off playedAs she was walking on by the arcadeAs the light bust through a beat-up shadeWhere he was wakin\\' upShe dropped a coin into the cupOf a blind man at the gateAnd forgot about a simple twist of fate\\n\\n[Verse 1]Nobody feels any painTonight as I stand inside the rainEverybody knows that baby\\'s got new clothesBut lately I see her ribbons and her bowsHave fallen from her curls[Chorus]She takes just like a woman, yeah she doesShe makes love just like a woman, yeah she doesAnd she aches just like a womanBut she breaks just like a little girl[Verse 2]Queen Mary, she\\'s my friendYes, I believe I\\'ll go see her againNobody has to guess that baby can\\'t be blessed\\'Til she finally sees that she\\'s like all the restWith her fog, her amphetamine and her pearls[Chorus]She takes just like a woman, yesShe makes love just like a woman, yeah she doesAnd she aches just like a womanBut she breaks just like a little girl\\n\\nA tear goes down my day is realBut your drying eye upon the shameEach needs a road for me from youWhat paradise? what can I do?That die for my and the day is darkI can’t believe for your touchWhat I could find oh

I knew it in your eyesWell I feel your love and I feel no shameI can’t unleash your horde I call your nameWhat you’re to me what can I do?To fall in love to fall in loveTo fall in love with youIt just rolls upon the sandEver this for now I’m made a manCan make you see what I can findI know it in my days ah in my daily mindOh will ages roll will ages fly?I hear your name where angels lieWhat do I

MobileWith the Memphis blues again[Verse 2]Well, Shakespeare, he\\'s in the alleyWith his pointed shoes and his bellsSpeaking to some French girlWho says she knows me wellAnd I would send a messageTo find out if she\\'s talkedBut the post office has been stolenAnd the mailbox is locked\\n\\n[Verse 1]The sweet pretty things are in bed now, of courseThe city fathers, they’re trying to endorseThe reincarnation of Paul Revere’s horseBut the town has no need to be nervousThe ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her witsTo Jezebel, the nun, she violently knitsA bald wig for Jack the Ripper who sitsAt the head of the chamber of commerce[Chorus]Mama’s in the factoryShe ain\\'t got no shoesDaddy’s in the alleyHe’s lookin\\' for foodI am in the kitchenWith the tombstone blues[Verse 2]The

there wasWhen they asked him why it had to be that way, “Well,” he answered“Just because”Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to lastThey called Joe “Crazy,” the baby they called “Kid Blast”Some say they lived off gambling and runnin’ numbers tooIt always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue[Chorus]Joey, JoeyKing of the streets, child of clayJoey, JoeyWhat made them want to come and blow you away?[Verse 2]There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from thatNo one ever knew for sure where they were really atWhen they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost hit the roofHe went out that night to seek revenge, thinking he was bulletproofThe war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streetsJoey and his brothers suffered terrible defeatsTill they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisonersThey stashed them away in a basement, called them amateurs\\n\\n'"
