laying in bedWondering if she\\'d changed at allIf her hair was still redHer folks they said our lives togetherSure was going to be roughThey never did like Mama\\'s homemade dressPapa\\'s bankbook wasn\\'t big enoughAnd I was standing on the side of the roadRain falling on my shoesHeading out for the East CoastLord knows I\\'ve paid some duesGetting throughTangled up in blue[Verse 2]She was married when we first metSoon to be divorcedI helped her out of a jam, I guessBut I used a little too much forceWe drove that car as far as we couldAbandoned it out westSplit up on a dark sad nightBoth agreeing it was bestShe turned around to look at meAs I was walking awayI heard her say over my shoulder\"We\\'ll meet again somedayOn the avenue\"Tangled up in blue\\n\\n[Verse 1]Darkness at the break of noonShadows even the silver spoonThe handmade blade, the child\\'s balloonEclipses both the sun and moonTo understand you know too soonThere is no sense in trying[Verse 2]Pointed threats they bluff with scornSuicide remarks are tornFrom the fool\\'s gold mouthpiece the hollow hornPlays wasted words, proves to warnThat he not busy being bornIs busy dying[Verse 3]Temptation\\'s page flies out the doorYou follow, find yourself at warWatch waterfalls of pity roarYou feel to moan, but unlike beforeYou discover that you\\'d just be one morePerson crying[Chorus]So don\\'t fear if

mighty trapsPounced with fire on flaming roadsUsing ideas as my maps\"We\\'ll meet on edges, soon,\" said IProud \\'neath heated brow[Refrain]Ah, but I was so much older thenI\\'m younger than that now[Verse 2]Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth\"Rip down all hate,\" I screamedLies that life is black and whiteSpoke from my skull, I dreamedRomantic facts of musketeersFoundationed deep, somehow[Refrain]Ah, but I was so much older thenI\\'m younger than that now[Verse 3]Girls\\' faces formed the forward pathFrom phony jealousyTo memorizing politicsOf ancient historyFlung down by corpse evangelistsUnthought of, though, somehow\\n\\n[Verse 1]If you’re travelin\\' in the north country fairWhere the winds hit heavy on the borderlineRemember me to one who lives thereFor she once was a true love of mine[Verse 2]If you go when the snowflakes stormWhen the rivers freeze and summer endsPlease see she has a coat so warmTo keep her from the howling winds[Verse 3]Please see if her hair hangs longIf it rolls and flows all down her breastPlease see for me if her hair\\'s hangin\\' longFor that’s the way I remember her best[Verse 4]I’m a-wondering if she remembers me at allMany times I’ve often prayedIn the darkness of my nightIn the brightness of my day[Instrumental Break]\\n\\n[Verse 1]Come, you masters of war, you that build the big gunsYou that build the death planes,

with my world like it\\'s your little toyYou put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyesAnd you turn and run farther when the fast bullets fly[Verse 3]Like Judas of old, you lie and deceiveA world war can be won you want me to believeBut I see through your eyes and I see through your brainLike I see through the water that runs down my drain[Verse 4]You fasten all the triggers for the others to fireThen you set back and watch while the death count gets higherYou hide in your mansion while the young people\\'s bloodFlows out of their bodies and is buried in the mud[Verse 5]You\\'ve thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurledFear to bring children into the worldFor threatening my baby, unborn and unnamedYou ain\\'t worth the blood that runs in your veins\\n\\n[Verse 1]You must leave now, take what you need, you think will lastBut whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fastYonder stands your orphan with his gunCrying like a fire in the sunLook out, the saints are coming throughAnd it\\'s all over now, Baby Blue[Verse 2]The highway is for gamblers, better use your senseTake what you have gathered from coincidenceThe empty-handed painter from your streetsIs drawing crazy patterns on your sheetsThe sky, too, is folding under youAnd it\\'s all over now, Baby Blue[Verse 3]All your seasick sailors, they are rowing homeYour empty-handed armies are going homeYour lover, who just walked out the doorHas taken all his blankets from the floorThe carpet, too, is moving under youAnd it\\'s all over now, Baby Blue[Instrumental Bridge]\\n\\n[Verse 1]You walk into the roomWith your pencil in your handYou see somebody nakedAnd you, you say, \"Who is that man?\"You try so hardBut you don\\'t understandJust what you will sayWhen you get home[Refrain]Because something

landin\\'?[Verse 2]No, there\\'s nothin\\' you can send me, my own true loveThere\\'s nothin\\' I\\'m a-wishing to be ownin\\'Just a-carry yourself back to me unspoiledFrom across that lonesome ocean[Verse 3]Ah, but I just thought you might want somethin\\' fineMade of silver or of goldenEither from the mountains of MadridOr from the coast of Barcelona[Verse 4]But if I had the stars of the darkest nightAnd the diamonds from the deepest oceanI\\'d forsake them all for your sweet kissFor that\\'s all I\\'m wishin\\' to be ownin\\'[Verse 5]Well, I might be gone a long old timeAnd it\\'s only that I\\'m askingIs there somethin\\' I can send you to remember me byTo make your time more easy passin\\'?\\n\\n[Verse 1]Ain\\'t it just like the night to playTricks when you\\'re trying to be so quiet?We sit here strandedThough we\\'re all doing our best to deny itAnd Louise holds a handful of rain, tempting you to defy itLights flicker from the opposite loftIn this room the heat pipes just coughThe country music station plays softBut there\\'s nothing, really nothing to turn offJust Louise and her lover so entwinedAnd these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind[Verse 2]In the empty lot where the ladies playBlindman\\'s bluff with the key chainAnd the all-night girlsThey whisper of escapades out on the \"D\" trainWe can hear the night watchman click his flashlightAsk himself if it\\'s him or them that\\'s insaneLouise, she\\'s all right, she\\'s just nearShe\\'s delicate and seems like the mirrorBut she just makes it all too concise and too clearThat Johanna\\'s not hereThe ghost of \\'lectricity howls in the bones of her faceWhere these visions of Johanna have now taken my place\\n\\n[Verse 1]\\'Twas in another lifetimeOne of toil and bloodWhen blackness was a virtueThe road was full of mudI came in from the wildernessA creature void of form\"Come in,\" she said, \"I\\'ll give yaShelter from the storm\"[Verse 2]And if I pass this way againYou can rest assuredI\\'ll always do my best for herOn that I give my wordIn a world of steel-eyed death and menWho are fighting to be warm\"Come in,\" she said, \"I\\'ll give yaShelter from the storm\"[Verse 3]Not a word was spoke between usThere was little risk involvedEverything up to that pointHad been left unresolvedTry imagining a placeWhere it\\'s always safe and warm\"Come in,\" she said, \"I\\'ll give yaShelter from the storm\"\\n\\n[Verse 1]The pale moon rose in its gloryOut o\\'er the Western townShe told a sad, sad storyOf the great ship that went down[Verse 2]T\\'was the fourteenth day of AprilOver the waves she rodeSailing into tomorrowTo a gilded age foretold[Verse 3]The night was black with starlightThe seas were sharp and clearMoving through the shadowsThe promised hour was near[Verse 4]Lights were holding steadyGliding over the foamAll the lords and ladiesHeading for their eternal home[Verse 5]The chandeliers were swayingFrom the balustrades aboveThe orchestra was playingSongs of faded love\\n\\n[Verse 1]Lay, lady, layLay across my big brass bedLay, lady, layLay across my big brass bedWhatever colors you have in your mindI’ll show them to you and you’ll see

makeEverything\\'s flowing all at the same timeI live on a boulevard of crimeI drive fast cars, and I eat fast foodsI contain multitudes\\n\\n[Verse 1]Someone’s got it in for meThey’re planting stories in the pressWhoever it is I wish they’d cut it out quickBut when they will I can only guessThey say I shot a man named GrayAnd took his wife to ItalyShe inherited a million bucksAnd when she died it came to meI can’t help it if I’m lucky[Verse 2]People see me all the timeAnd they just can’t remember how to actTheir minds are filled with big ideasImages and distorted factsEven you,

the backroads heading southIdiot windBlowing every time you move your teethYou’re an idiot, babeIt’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe\\n\\n[Verse 1]They sat together in the parkAs the evening sky grew darkShe looked at him and he felt a sparkTingle to his bones\\'Twas then he felt aloneAnd wished that he\\'d gone straightAnd watched out for a simple twist of fate[Verse 2]They walked alone by the old canalA little confused, I remember wellAnd stopped into a strange hotelWith a neon burning brightHe felt the heat of the nightHit him like a freight trainMoving with a simple twist of fate[Verse 3]A saxophone someplace far-off playedAs she was walking on by the arcadeAs the light bust through a beat-up shadeWhere he was wakin\\' upShe dropped a coin into the cupOf a blind man at the gateAnd forgot about a simple twist of fate\\n\\n[Verse 1]Nobody feels any painTonight as I stand inside the rainEverybody knows that baby\\'s got new clothesBut lately I see her ribbons and her bowsHave fallen from her curls[Chorus]She takes just like a woman, yeah she doesShe makes love just like a woman, yeah she doesAnd she aches just like a womanBut she breaks just like a little girl[Verse 2]Queen Mary, she\\'s my friendYes, I believe I\\'ll go see her againNobody has to guess that baby can\\'t be blessed\\'Til she finally sees that she\\'s like all the restWith her fog, her amphetamine and her pearls[Chorus]She takes just like a woman, yesShe makes love just like a woman, yeah she doesAnd she aches just like a womanBut she breaks just like a little girl\\n\\nA tear goes down my day is realBut your drying eye upon the shameEach needs a road for me from youWhat paradise? what can I do?That die for my and the day is darkI can’t believe for your touchWhat I could find oh

I knew it in your eyesWell I feel your love and I feel no shameI can’t unleash your horde I call your nameWhat you’re to me what can I do?To fall in love to fall in loveTo fall in love with youIt just rolls upon the sandEver this for now I’m made a manCan make you see what I can findI know it in my days ah in my daily mindOh will ages roll will ages fly?I hear your name where angels lieWhat do I

MobileWith the Memphis blues again[Verse 2]Well, Shakespeare, he\\'s in the alleyWith his pointed shoes and his bellsSpeaking to some French girlWho says she knows me wellAnd I would send a messageTo find out if she\\'s talkedBut the post office has been stolenAnd the mailbox is locked\\n\\n[Verse 1]The sweet pretty things are in bed now, of courseThe city fathers, they’re trying to endorseThe reincarnation of Paul Revere’s horseBut the town has no need to be nervousThe ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her witsTo Jezebel, the nun, she violently knitsA bald wig for Jack the Ripper who sitsAt the head of the chamber of commerce[Chorus]Mama’s in the factoryShe ain\\'t got no shoesDaddy’s in the alleyHe’s lookin\\' for foodI am in the kitchenWith the tombstone blues[Verse 2]The

armAnd a coat of solid goldSearching for the very soulsWhom already have been sold[Verse 2]“Arise, arise,” he cried so loudWith a voice without restraint“Come out, ye gifted kings and queensAnd hear my sad complaintNo martyr is among ye nowWhom you can call your ownBut go on your way accordinglyBut know you’re not alone”[Verse 3]I dreamed I saw St. AugustineAlive with fiery breathAnd I dreamed I

It\\'s not a poem, it\\'s... This is the first concert I played alone in New York, really. An a fellow in Brooklyn State Hospital, his name is Woody Guthrie. But Woody is more than a folk singer. He\\'s really something else more than a folk singer and there\\'s this book coming out that\\'s dedicated to him. And they asked me to write something about Woody, like what does Woody mean to you in 25 words. And I couldn\\'t do it, I wrote out 5 pages and I have it here. I have it here by accident actually. But I\\'d like to say this out loud. So this is my feelings towards Woody Guthrie. Cannot really be told in how many records of his I buy, it\\'s a lot more than that actually. So if you can roll along with this thing here this is called \"Last Thoughts On Woody Guthrie\"[Verse 1]When yer head gets twisted and yer mind grows numbWhen you think you\\'re too old, too young, too smart or too dumbWhen yer laggin\\' behind an\\' losing yer paceIn a slow-motion crawl of life\\'s busy raceNo matter what yer doing if you start givin\\' upIf the wine don\\'t come to the top of yer cupIf the wind\\'s got you sideways with one hand holdin\\' onAnd the other starts slipping and the feeling is goneAnd yer train engine fire needs a new spark to catch itAnd the wood\\'s easy findin\\' but yer lazy to fetch itAnd yer sidewalk starts curlin\\' and the street gets too longAnd you start walkin\\' backwards though you know its wrongAnd lonesome comes up as down goes the dayAnd tomorrow\\'s morning seems so far awayAnd you feel the reins from yer pony are slippin\\'And yer rope is a-slidin\\' cause yer hands are a-drippin\\'And yer sun-decked desert and evergreen valleysTurn to broken down slums and trash-can alleysAnd yer sky cries water and yer drain pipe\\'s a-pourin\\'And the lightnin\\'s a-flashing and the thunder\\'s a-crashin\\'And the windows are rattlin\\' and breakin\\' and the roof tops a-shakin\\'And yer whole world\\'s a-slamming  and bangingAnd yer minutes of sun turn to hours of stormAnd to yourself you sometimes say\"I never knew it was gonna be this wayWhy didn\\'t they tell me the day I was born\"And you start gettin\\' chills and yer jumping from sweatAnd you\\'re looking for something you ain\\'t quite found yetAnd yer knee-deep in the dark water with yer hands in the airAnd the whole world\\'s a-watching with a window peek stareAnd yer good gal leaves and she\\'s long gone a-flyingAnd yer heart feels sick like fish when they\\'re fryingAnd yer jackhammer falls from yer hand to yer feetAnd you need it badly but it lays on the streetAnd yer bell\\'s bangin\\' loudly but you can\\'t hear its beatAnd you think yer ears might a been hurtOr yer eyes\\'ve turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirtAnd you figured you failed in yesterdays rushWhen you were faked out an\\' fooled while facing a four flushAnd all the time you were holdin\\' three queensAnd it\\'s making you mad, it\\'s makin\\' you meanLike in the middle of Life magazineBouncin\\' around a pinball machineAnd there\\'s something on yer mind you wanna be sayingThat somebody someplace oughta be hearin\\'But it\\'s trapped on yer tongue and sealed in yer headAnd it bothers you badly when you\\'re laying in bedAnd no matter how you try you just can\\'t say itAnd yer scared to yer soul you just might forget itAnd yer eyes get swimmy from the tears in yer headAnd yer pillows of feathers turn to blankets of leadAnd the lion\\'s mouth opens and yer staring at his teethAnd his jaws start closing with you underneathAnd yer flat on your belly with yer hands tied behindAnd you wish you\\'d never taken that last detour signAnd you say to yourself just what am I doingOn this road I\\'m walkin\\', on this trail I\\'m turnin\\'On this curve I\\'m hangingOn this pathway I\\'m strolling, in the space I\\'m takingIn this air I\\'m inhalingAm I mixed up too much, am I mixed up too hardWhy am I walking, where am I runningWhat am I saying, what am I knowingOn this guitar I\\'m playing, on this banjo I\\'m frailin\\'On this mandolin I\\'m strumming, in the song I\\'m singin\\'In the tune I\\'m humming, in the words I\\'m writin\\'In the words that I\\'m thinkingIn this ocean of hours I\\'m all the time drinkin\\'Who am I helping, what am I breakingWhat am I giving, what am I takingBut you try with your whole soul bestNever to think these thoughts and never to letThem kind of thoughts gain groundOr make yer heart poundBut then again you know when they\\'re aroundJust waiting for a chance to slip and drop down\\'Cause sometimes you hear\\'em when the night times comes creepingAnd you fear that they might catch you a-sleepingAnd you jump from yer bed, from yer last chapter of dreamin\\'And you can\\'t remember for the best of yer thinkingIf that was you in the dream that was screamingAnd you know that it\\'s something special you\\'re needin\\'And you know that there\\'s no drug that\\'ll do for the healin\\'And no liquor in the land to stop yer brain from bleedingAnd you need something specialYeah, you need something special all rightYou need a fast flying train on a tornado trackTo shoot you someplace and shoot you backYou need a cyclone wind on a stream engine howlerThat\\'s been banging and booming and blowing foreverThat knows yer troubles a hundred times overYou need a Greyhound bus that don\\'t bar no raceThat won\\'t laugh at yer looksYour voice or your faceAnd by any number of bets in the bookWill be rolling long after the bubblegum crazeYou need something to open up a new doorTo show you something you seen beforeBut overlooked a hundred times or moreYou need something to open your eyesYou need something to make it knownThat it\\'s you and no one else that ownsThat spot that yer standing, that space that you\\'re sittingThat the world ain\\'t got you beatThat it ain\\'t got you lickedIt can\\'t get you crazy no matter how manyTimes you might get kickedYou need something special all rightYou need something special to give you hopeBut hope\\'s just a wordThat maybe you said or maybe you heardOn some windy corner \\'round a wide-angled curve\\n\\n[Verse 1]Some of us turn off the lights and we liveWith the moonlight shooting bySome of us scare ourselves to death in the darkTo be where the angels flyPretty maids all in a row lined upOutside my cabin doorI\\'ve never wanted any of them wanting meExcept the girl from the Red River Shore[Verse 2]Well, I sat by her side and for a while I triedTo make that girl my wifeShe gave me her best advice and she saidGo home and lead a quiet lifeWell, I been to the east and I been to the westAnd I been out where the black winds roarSomehow though I never did get that farWith the girl from the Red River Shore[Verse 3]Well, I knew when I first laid eyes on herI could never be freeOne look at her and I knew right awayShe should always be with meWell, the dream dried up a long time agoDon\\'t know where it is anymoreTrue to life, true to meWas the girl from the Red River Shore\\n\\n[Verse 1]I once loved a girl, her skin it was bronzeWith the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawnI courted her proudly but now she is goneGone as the season she\\'s taken[Verse 2]In a young summer\\'s youth, I stole her awayFrom her mother and sister, though close did they stayEach one of them suffering from the failures of their dayWith strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us[Verse 3]Of the two sisters, I loved the youngWith sensitive instincts, she was the creative oneTheir constant scrapegoat, she was easily undoneBy the jealousy of others around her[Verse 4]For her parasite sister, I had no respectBound by her boredom, her pride to protectCountless visions of the other she\\'d reflectAs a crutch for her scenes and her society[Verse 5]Myself, for what I did, I cannot be excusedThe changes I was going through can\\'t even be usedFor the lies that I told her in hope not to loseThe could-be dream-lover of my lifetime\\n\\n[Verse 1]SometimesI feel so low-down and disgustedCan\\'t help but wonder what\\'s happening to my companionsAre they lost or are they found?Have they counted the cost it\\'ll take to bring downAll their earthly principles they\\'re going to have to abandon?[Chorus]And there\\'s a slow, slow train coming up around the bend[Verse 2]I had a womanDown in AlabamaShe was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realisticShe said, \"Boy, without a doubtHave to quit your mess and straighten outYou could die down here, be just another accident statistic\"[Chorus]And there\\'s a slow, slow train coming up around the bend[Verse 3]All that foreign oilControlling American soilLook around you, it\\'s just bound to make you embarrassedSheiks walking around like kingsWearing fancy jewels and nose ringsDeciding America\\'s future from Amsterdam and Paris\\n\\n[Verse 1]Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spendBe it mine right or wrongfullyI let it slip gladly to my friendsTo tie up the time most forcefully[Chorus]But the bottles are doneWe\\'ve killed each one and the table\\'s full and overflowedAnd the corner sign says it\\'s closin\\' timeSo I\\'ll bid farewell and be down the road[Verse 2]Oh, every girl that ever I\\'ve touchedI did not do it harmfullyAnd every girl that ever I\\'ve hurtI did not do it knowingly[Chorus]But to remain as friendsYou need the time to make amends and stay behindAnd since my feet are now fast and point away from the pastI\\'ll bid farewell and be down the line[Verse 3]Oh, every foe that ever I facedThe cause was there before we cameAnd every cause that ever I foughtI fought it full without regret or shame\\n\\n[Verse 1]John Wesley HardingWas a friend to the poorHe traveled a\\'with a gun in ev\\'ry handAll along this countrysideHe opened a\\'many a doorBut he was never knownTo hurt an honest man[Verse 2]’Twas down in Chaynee CountyA time they talk aboutWith his lady by his sideHe took a standAnd soon the situation thereWas all but straightened outFor he was always knownTo lend a helping hand[Verse 3]All across the telegraphHis name it did resoundBut no charge held against himCould they proveAnd there was no man aroundWho could track or chain him downHe was never knownTo make a foolish move\\n\\n[Verse 1]As I went out one morningTo breathe the air around Tom Paine’sI spied the fairest damselThat ever did walk in chainsI offered her my handShe took me by the armI knew that very instantShe meant to do me harm[Verse 2]“Depart from me this moment”I told her with my voiceSaid she, “But I don’t wish to”Said I, “But you have no choice”“I beg you, sir,” she pleadedFrom the corners of her mouth“I will secretly accept youAnd together we’ll fly south”[Verse 3]Just then Tom Paine, himselfCame running from across the fieldShouting at this lovely girlAnd commanding her to yieldAnd as she was letting go her gripUp Tom Paine did run“I’m sorry, sir,” he said to me“I’m sorry for what she’s done”\\n\\n[Verse 1]I\\'ve been a moonshinerFor seventeen long yearsI\\'ve spent all my moneyOn whiskey and beerI go to some hollowAnd sit at my stillAnd if whiskey don\\'t kill meThen I don\\'t know what will[Harmonica Solo][Verse 2]I go to some bar roomAnd drink with my friendsWhere the women can\\'t followAnd see what I spendGod bless them pretty womenI wish they was mineTheir breath is as sweetThe dew on the vine[Harmonica Solo][Verse 3]Let me eat when I am hungryLet me drink when I am dryA dollar when I am hard upReligion when I dieThe whole world\\'s a bottleAnd life\\'s but a dramWhen the bottle gets emptyIt sure ain\\'t worth a damn\\n\\n[Verse 1]Up on the white verandaShe wears a necktie and a Panama hatHer passport shows a faceFrom another time and placeShe looks nothing like thatAnd all the remnants of her recent pastAre scattered in the wild windShe walks across the marble floorWhere a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on inShe smiles, walks the other wayAs the last ship sails and the moon fades awayFrom Black Diamond Bay[Verse 2]As the morning light breaks open, the Greek comes downAnd he asks for a rope and a pen that will write“Pardon, monsieur,” the desk clerk saysCarefully removes his fez“Am I hearing you right?”And as the yellow fog is liftingThe Greek is quickly heading for the second floorShe passes him on the spiral staircaseThinking he’s the Soviet AmbassadorShe starts to speak, but he walks awayAs the storm clouds rise and the palm branches swayOn Black Diamond Bay\\n\\n[Verse 1]What’s the matter with meI don’t have much to sayDaylight sneaking through the windowAnd I’m still in this all-night caféWalking to and fro beneath the moonOut to where the trucks are rolling slowTo sit down on this bank of sandAnd watch the river flow[Verse 2]Wish I was back in the cityInstead of this old bank of sandWith the sun beating down over the chimney topsAnd the one I love so close at handIf I had wings and I could flyI know where I would goBut right now I’ll just sit here so contentedlyAnd watch the river flow[Chorus]People disagreeing on all just about everything, yeahMakes you stop and all wonder whyWhy only yesterday I saw somebody on the streetWho just couldn’t help but cryOh, this old river keeps on rolling, thoughNo matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blowAnd as long as it does I’ll just sit hereAnd watch the river flow\\n\\n[Verse 1]Well, there was this movie I seen one timeAbout a man riding ’cross the desert and it starred Gregory PeckHe was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himselfThe townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck[Verse 2]Well, the marshal, now he beat that kid to a bloody pulpAs the dying gunfighter lay in the sun and gasped for his last breath“Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and squareI want him to feel what it’s like to every moment face his death”[Verse 3]Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling inAnd you know it blows right through me like a ball and chainYou know I can’t believe we’ve lived so long and are still so far apartThe memory of you keeps calling after me like a rolling train[Verse 4]I can still see the day that you came to me on the painted desertIn your busted down Ford and your platform heelsI could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meetAh, but you were right. It was perfect as I got in behind the wheel[Verse 5]Well, we drove that car all night into San Anton’And we slept near the Alamo, your skin was so tender and softWay down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came backI would have gone on after you but I didn’t feel like letting my head get blown off\\n\\n[Verse 1]If I had wingsLike Noah\\'s DoveI’d fly the riverTo the one I loveFare thee well, my honeyFare thee well[Verse 2]I had a manWho was long and tallMoved his bodyLike a cannonballFare thee well, my honeyFare thee well[Verse 3]Remember one eveningWas drizzling rainAnd around my heartI felt an aching painFare thee well, my honeyFare thee well[Verse 4]Once I woreMy apron lowCouldn’t keep youAway from my doorFare thee well, my honeyFare thee well\\n\\n[Verse 1]Señor, señor, can you tell me where we\\'re headin\\'Lincoln County Road or ArmageddonSeems like I been down this way beforeIs there any truth in that, señor[Verse 2]Señor, señor, do you know where she\\'s hidin\\'?How long are we gonna be riding?How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?Will there be any comfort there, señor?[Chorus 1]There\\'s a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deckAnd there\\'s an iron cross still hanging from around her neckThere\\'s a marching band still playing in that vacant lotWhere\\'s she held me in her arms one time and said\"Forget me not\"[Verse 4]Señor, señor, I can see that painted wagonSmell the tail of the dragonI can\\'t stand the suspense here anymoreCan you tell me who to contact here, señor?[Solo]\\n\\n[Verse 1]Well, the pressure’s down, the boss ain\\'t hereHe gone North, for a whileThey say that vanity got the best of himBut he sure left here in styleBy the way, that’s a cute hatAnd that smile’s so hard to resistBut what’s a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?[Verse 2]You know, I once knew a woman who looked like youShe wanted a whole man, not just a halfShe used to call me sweet daddy when I was only a childYou kind of remind me of her when you laughIn order to deal in this game, got to make the queen disappearIt’s done with a flick of the wristWhat’s a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?[Verse 3]You know, a woman like you should be at homeThat’s where you belongWatching out for someone who loves you trueWho would never do you wrongJust how much abuse will you be able to take?Well, there’s no way to tell by that first kissWhat’s a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?\\n\\n[Intro]Broken lines, broken stringsBroken threads, broken springsBroken idols, broken

tonight\\n\\nWe carried you in our arms on Independence DayAnd now you\\'d throw us all aside and put us on our wayOh, what dear daughter \\'neath the sun would treat a father soTo wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer no?Tears of rage, tears of griefWhy am I always the one who must be the thief?Come to me now, you know we\\'re so aloneAnd life is briefIt was all pointed out the way to go and scratched your name in sandThough you just thought that it was nothing more than a place for you to standNow I want you to know that while you were watched, discovered that there was no one trueThat I myself really thoughtIt was just a childish thing to doTears of rage, tears of griefWhy am I always the one who must be the thief?Come to me now, you know we\\'re so aloneAnd life is briefIt was all very, very painless when you ran out to receiveAll that false instruction which we never could believeAnd now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purseOh, but what kind of love is this which goes from bad to worse?\\n\\n[Verse 1]Rambling out of the wild WestLeaving the towns I love the bestThought I’d seen some ups and downs\\'Til I come into New York townPeople going down to the groundBuildings going up to the sky[Verse 2]Wintertime in New York townThe wind blowing snow aroundWalk around with nowhere to goSomebody could freeze right to the boneI froze right to the boneNew York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen yearsI didn’t feel so cold then[Verse 3]I swung on to my old guitarGrabbed hold of a subway carAnd after a rocking, reeling, rolling rideI landed up on the downtown sideGreenwich Village[Verse 4]I walked down there and ended upIn one of them coffeehouses on the blockI get on the stage to sing and playMan there said, “Come back some

shadows rollAnd I\\'ll be with you when the deal goes down[Verse 3]The moon gives light and shines by nightI scarcely feel the glowWe learn to live and then we forgiveO\\'er the road we\\'re bound to goMore frailer than the flowers, these precious hoursThat keep us so tightly boundYou come to my eyes like a vision from the skiesAnd I\\'ll be with you when the deal goes down\\n\\n[Verse 1]The

for a homeIf you don\\'t like it you can leave me alone[Verse 3]I can snap my fingers and require the rainFrom a clear blue sky and turn it off againI can stroke your body and relieve your painAnd charm the whistle off an evening train\\n\\n[Verse 1]Highway 51 runs right by my baby\\'s doorHighway 51 runs right by my baby\\'s doorIf I don\\'t get the girl I\\'m loving, won\\'t go down Highway

like to surround youBounty hunters are dancing all around youBilly, they don\\'t like you to be so free[Verse 2]Camping out all night on the verandaWalking in the streets down by the haciendaUp to Boot Hill they\\'d like to send youBilly, don\\'t you turn your back on me[Verse 3]There\\'s mills inside the minds of crazy facesBullet holes and rifles in their casesThere is always one more notch in four more acesBilly, and you\\'re playing all alone[Verse 4]Playing around with some sweet signoritaInto her dark chamber she will greet youIn the shadows of the mesa she will lead youBilly, and you\\'re going all alone[Verse 5]They say that Pat Garrett\\'s got your numberSo sleep with one eye open when you wonderIf every little sound just might be thunderThunder from the barrel of his gun\\n\\n[Verse 1]Well, I’m stranded in the city that never sleepsSome of these women they just give me the creepsI’m avoidin’ the Southside the best I canThese memories I got, they can strangle a man[Verse 2]Well I came ashore in the dead of the nightLot of things can get in the way when you’re tryin’ to do what’s rightYou don’t understand it—my feelings for youYou’d be honest with me if only you knew[Verse 3]I’m not sorry for nothin’ I’ve doneI’m glad I fought—I only wish we’d wonThe Siamese twins are comin’ to townPeople can’t wait—they’re gathered around[Verse 4]When I left my home the sky split open wideI never wanted to go back there—I’d rather have diedYou don’t understand it—my feelings for youYou’d be honest with me if only you knew[Verse 5]My woman got a face like a teddy bearShe’s tossin’ a baseball bat in the airThe meat is so tough you can’t cut it with a swordI’m crashin’ my car, trunk first into the boards\\n\\n[Verse 1]Bye and bye, I\\'m breathin\\' a lover\\'s sighWhile I\\'m sittin\\' on my watch so I can be on timeI\\'m singin\\' love\\'s praises with sugar-coated rhymeBye and bye, on you I\\'m casting my eye[Verse 2]I\\'m paintin\\' the town, swinging my partner aroundWell, I know who I can depend on, I know who to trustI\\'m watchin\\' the roads, I\\'m studying the dustI\\'m paintin\\' the townMaking my last go-round[Chorus]Well, I\\'m scufflin\\' and I\\'m shufflin\\' and I\\'m walkin\\' on briarsI\\'m not even acquainted with my own desires[Verse 3]I\\'m rollin\\' slowI\\'m doing all I knowI\\'m tellin\\' myself I found true happinessThat I\\'ve still got a dream that hasn\\'t been repossessedI\\'m rollin\\' slowGoin\\' where the wild roses grow[Chorus]Well, the future for me is already a thing of the pastYou were my first love and you will be my last\\n\\n[Verse 1]Went to see the gypsyStaying in a big hotelHe smiled when he saw me comingAnd he said, “Well, well, well”His room was dark and crowdedLights were low and dim“How are you?” he said to meI said it back to him[Verse 2]I went down to the lobbyTo make a small call outA pretty dancing girl was thereAnd she began to shout“Go on back to see the gypsyHe can move you from the rearDrive you from your fearBring you through the mirrorHe did it in Las VegasAnd he can do it here”[Verse 3]Outside the lights were shiningOn the river of tearsI watched them from the distanceWith music in my ears\\n\\n[Verse 1]Oh, well, I love ya pretty babyYou\\'re the only love I\\'ve ever knownJust as long as you stay with meThe whole world is my throne[Refrain]Beyond here lies nothinNothin we can call our own[Verse 2]Well, I\\'m moving after midnightDown boulevards of broken carsDon\\'t know what I\\'d do without itWithout this love that we call ours[Refrain]Beyond here lies nothinNothin but the moon and stars[Verse 3]Down every street there\\'s a windowAnd every window made of glassWe\\'ll keep on loving, pretty babyFor as long as love will last\\n\\n[Verse 1]Come
